<p align="left">Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian man who lived in the time of the Renaissance. He is famous for his paintings,[1] but he was also a scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, sculptor, architect, botanist, musician, and a writer. Leonardo wanted to know everything about nature. He wanted to know how everything worked. He was very good at studying, designing and making all sorts of interesting things.[2] He is not to be confused with Leonardo Vinci, Italian music composer.</p>
